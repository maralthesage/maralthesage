# 👋 Hello, I’m Maral

I’m a **Data Scientist** passionate about transforming data into actionable insights and building intelligent solutions with **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI**.  
I enjoy designing **scalable data pipelines**, developing **predictive models**, and experimenting with **LLMs for real-world applications**.  

Coding is not just my work—it’s my playground. Let’s connect, collaborate, and learn together! 🚀

## 🔍 What I Do
- 📊 **Data Science & Analytics**: Predictive modeling, feature engineering, customer segmentation, and demand forecasting.  
- 🧠 **Deep Learning & LLMs**: NLP, RAG systems, multilingual chatbots, and generative AI applications.  
- ⚙️ **Data Engineering**: Automated **ETL/ELT pipelines** (PySpark, Prefect, Airflow), change data capture (CDC), and data warehousing.  
- 📈 **Visualization & BI**: Interactive dashboards and KPIs with **Qlik, Tableau, Plotly/Dash**.  
- 🐳 **MLOps**: Deploying models with **Flask, Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**.
