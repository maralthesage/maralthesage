## Intro
Hi AllðŸ‘‹,
I am a data scientist with an interest in extracting meaningful insights from data and make data-driven decisions. I am also interested in developing solutions that can benefit myself or others. For that, I am opening to learning new skills in coding and design, whatever it takes to build an idea into a software/app or any useful format.
